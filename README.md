Welcome and take a gander at my source code for my [Neocities website](https://10kph.neocities.org). Note that some of the pages are not committed here, due to the content.

For your browsing experience, please click **Code** at the top of a Markdown file instead of **Preview**.

The site is built with 11ty and TufteCSS as a base. See more info on [site credits](https://10kph.neocities.org/about/#site-credits).
