Howdy! I'm Kirsten (she/her) and I am both a woman of STEM and a woman of the arts. Software developer by day, fiction writer by (mid)night.

I hope to carve my own little cyberspace, sharing things I like and find interesting. Check out the sidebar on the left (or up top if you're on mobile) for navigation links, some quick info about yours truly, and site updates!

Thanks for visiting and take care!
