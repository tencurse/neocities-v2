  Hello and welcome! Happy you're here, but there's nothing to see (yet). Check
  back in later, won't you? :) Meanwhile, read on if you want to learn more
  about this site.

  I built this using
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>
  with the
  <a
    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer"
    target="_blank"
    >Live Server</a
  >
  Extension. Live Server helps to see the code changes in real time, so I don't
  spam the activity feed with updates. Plus, it's easier to code this way!
  <small>(Maybe I'll make a page on the other extensions I use?)</small>

  Terminal info above references the
  <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch" target="_blank">neofetch</a>
  command on Linux systems. Terminal theme is inspired by

  >.

<p>
  Dark color scheme is based on
  <a href="https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim" target="_blank"
    >Tokyo Night</a
  >
  theme. Light colour scheme is <i>not</i> based on Tokyo Night; instead I
  handpicked different colours to make the transition better. If you want to see
  other colour schemes,
  <a href="https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/" target="_blank">check this out</a>!

  Here's a

  on how I built the colour scheme button.
