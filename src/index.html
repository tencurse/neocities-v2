  Howdy! I'm Kirsten (she/her) and I am both a woman of STEM and a woman of the
  arts. Software developer by day, fiction writer by (mid)night.

  I hope to carve my own little cyberspace, sharing things I like and find
  interesting. Check out the sidebar on the left (or up top if you're on mobile)
  for navigation links, some quick info about yours truly, and site updates!

<p>Thanks for visiting and take care!</p>
