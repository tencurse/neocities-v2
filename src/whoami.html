<p>
  Howdy! I'm Kirsten (she/her) and I am both a woman of STEM and a woman of the
  arts. Software developer by day, fiction writer by (mid)night. I play the bass
  guitar as a hobby, largely inspired by Mitski and Arctic Monkeys. I love UNIX
  systems and how endlessly customizable they are. I enjoy playing video games
  and watching people play video games.
</p>
<p>
  I'm a proponent of open source software and the ad-free web. Use Mozilla
  Firefox, install adblock of your choice, install SponsorBlock for YouTube.
  Support open source software and independent creators whenever you can.
  Dual-boot Linux, or throw away Windows altogether.<sup

<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
  This mobile-friendly site is handcrafted using
  <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">11ty</a>,
  which is a static site generator. The aesthetic is inspired by UNIX systems
  and the terminal.
</p>
<p>
  I will post the source code on my GitHub soon, but for now, feel free to
  right-click, Inspect Element or View Page Source. Everyone copy-pastes code, I
  assure you, but if you do, please take the time to learn what you are
  copy-pasting. Arm yourself with knowledge. With that said, I'll also add a
  page for resources on the tools I use for web development. Soon(tm)
</p>
<p>For now, here are some basic details:</p>
<p>
  I built the site using
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>. The
  HTML, CSS and JS are coded by hand, in combination with 11ty to make
  templating easier.
</p>
<p>
  Terminal-style sidebar is inspired by
  <a
    href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster"
    target="_blank"
    >agnoster ohmyzsh theme</a
  >, and the 'fetch' command comes from
  <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch" target="_blank">neofetch</a>,
  commonly found on UNIX systems.
</p>
<p>
  Colour scheme is based on
  <a href="https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim" target="_blank"
    >Tokyo Night</a
  >, though the light theme is tweaked a little bit for a smoother transition. I
  plan on adding more colour schemes, and if you want to see more,

  Here's a
  <a
    href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web"
    target="_blank"
    >tutorial</a
  >
  on how I built the colour scheme button. I tweaked the JavaScript code a lot,
  and I'm sure I'll be changing it again in the future when I make it a toggle
  or a drop-down.

  If you're interested in learning web development basics (HTML/CSS, JavaScript,
  etc), I encourage you to check out
  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a
  >. It's a great course on web dev that teaches you the basics of the basics,
  encourages you to explore things for yourself, make your own mini-projects
  using what you learned, and see what others have created. It even teaches how
  to approach debugging, which is an <i>essential</i> skill when learning to
  code.<sup><a href="#foot-2" id="ref-2">2</a></sup>

  1: It's not always the easiest (or even practical) in a capitalist world like
  this one. But we do our best. <a href="#ref-1">↰</a>

  2: I found other free web dev courses are mostly built on memorization without
  <i>really</i> diving deep into the fundamentals of <i>why</i> and <i>how</i>,
  which leads to a lot of people not really understanding what they learned and
  feeling lost when there's no one to guide them. <a href="#ref-2">↰</a>
