Welcome to the first installment of “Web Surfing Adventures”: a roundup of cool websites and resources I find as I surf the web.

Featuring: personal websites by designers, brutalist websites, archives on casettes and diverse literature, and digital gardens.

## Web design and development

[Brutalist Websites](https://brutalistwebsites.com/) – a curated collection of websites with brutalist designs.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "The thumbnails load really slowly, at least in my experience." %} I’d like to make one of these some day.

[LiveTerm by Cveinnt](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm) – a tool to build interactive terminal style websites, powered by Next.js

[Codrops Playground](https://tympanus.net/codrops/category/playground/) – demos of cool web design and animations. I stumbled upon this a really long time ago, and I still refer to it sometimes as inspiration for cool web things.

[Specialized CSS frameworks](https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks#specialized) – a list of cool CSS libraries emulating a specific UI, i.e., Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows 7, NES, BIOS / MS–DOS.

[CSS variable theme switcher](https://lukelowrey.com/css-variable-theme-switcher/) – a simple tutorial on implementing a theme switcher on your site. I might pivot to this when I change my dark mode button!

[Terminal Hugo theme by panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) – a terminal style theme for Hugo.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Hugo is a static site generator based on Go." %} I dig the [aesthetic](https://hugo-terminal.vercel.app/).

[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) – a community–driven, free–licensed distribution of VS Code

[neovim](https://neovim.io/) – a Vim–based text editor. Haven’t tried it out personally but once I get my dual–boot Linux sorted out, I might check it out!

[expensive.toys](https://expensive.toys/) – this is a personal website, but the blog contains lots of cool CSS snippets!

[Digital Gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) – a curated list of digital gardening tools and resources

[Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) – a starter site/theme for digital gardens and backlinks, built in 11ty

## Random sites

[chia.neocities.org](https://chia.neocities.org/) – a hub of websites by Chia. Love the scrolling effects, the [about](https://chia.neocities.org/about) page, and the overall design. So simple, yet so pretty!

[chia.design](https://chia.design/) – a grid website of Chia’s projects and works (?). In love with the hover effects! Also, I’d like to check some of these out one day, considering a lot of these have to do with Filipino Internet culture.

[Philippine Casette Archive](https://philippinecassettearchive.com/) – another one of Chia’s websites. This is an archive of casettes released in the Philippines, complete with scanned photos of the inserts and the casette itself.

[The Literary Bisexual](https://theliterarybisexual.neocities.org/) – a curated list of books with bisexual characters. My reading list is looooong but I’d love to read some of these as well!

[azlen.me](https://azlen.me/) – really interesting personal site. Love the theme switcher. I recognize a little bit of Tufte CSS here, with a really cool implementation of the footnotes. Check out the shoes page.

[hex22](https://hex22.org/) – a personal website by Hunor. The first thing you see is a set of phone messages, called _Cybernetic Self–Portrait_.

[lifereference.neocities.org](https://lifereference.neocities.org/) (Link warning: autoplay) – a website full of links to resources from food to leftism to spirituality to queerness.

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) – a website on how to make your own programming language. I love the site’s typography and design.{%sidenote "Especially the sidenotes!" %}

[sheep.horse](https://sheep.horse/everything.html) – found a blog dating back to 2006 (!) and currently using a variation of the Tufte CSS layout. Lots of movie and book reviews, as well as writeups on programming and tech.

[Instant Pot Cooking Times](https://cookingtimes.info/) – I don’t have an instant pot but I’m sure this would come in handy if/when I get one. Also uses Tufte CSS. Neat!

[Tom Critchlow’s wikifolder](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) – a digital garden/wiki organized by tags/topic. I would love to create my own version of this here!
