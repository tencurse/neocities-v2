It’s only been a month since I started this site and I changed the layout already.

{% sidenote "The previous layout had two columns: one 280-px sidebar and the main content column. Check out the old index [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230529165943/https://10kph.neocities.org/), courtesy of web.archive.org" %}

In the midst of porting my [fics](/writing) to Neocities, I wanted those pages to be suitable for long–form reading. I came across [TufteCSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), which I found through [Project Tara](https://project-tara.neocities.org/).{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "A re–host of the infamous _My Immortal_ fanfiction." %} The layout was perfect for my needs, but I very quickly ran into a problem: there is now a huge clash between the main layout, and the Tufte layout.

{% sidenote "The blog page in the two column layout" %}

{% sidenote "A fic page in the Tufte layout (page not uploaded as of yet)" %}

Sure, I don’t need to be too bothered about it; after all, not all personal websites have consistency between their pages, and sometimes, they’re even more interesting for it! But then I kept switching through my blog page, which had the two–column layout, and the fic pages with the one–column, and it just really, _really_ bothered me that these two (technically) long–form content had different styles.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "I had previously reasoned that the blog and the story pages are completely different types of content, so the differing layouts might be acceptable, but in the end, I acquiesced." %}

I needed to redesign the entire site in such a way that it doesn’t lose its previous personality, while also having consistency between the long–form posts and everything else.

I nuked the old stylesheet and duplicated the modified Tufte over. A lot of the elements were changed, but the meat of it is essentially the same: one column to the left with space on the right for sidenotes/margin notes.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Pretty cool, eh? Try resizing the window!" %}

Here we are.

I’m not totally satisfied with it, because now it looks too simple and minimalist and I’m sure there’s a balance in there somewhere between having an interesting design while still being responsive and consistent. But unfortunately I am not a designer!{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Speaking of designers, I found some really cool personal websites (mostly by graphic designers) and I think I will make a post about those, just to share them with you all!" %}

There’s still a long way to go for this site. I haven’t completely archived all my fics here (I haven’t even uploaded them yet as of this blog post); I still have to figure out how to incorporate a Series, but most of it—one–shots and multi–chapters—are pretty much good to go. In essence, this site would be an archive of what I do/write, what I think, and what interests me. I’m sure there would be more design iterations of this site (\*shudder\*), but for now, this lends itself well to long–form reading, so here you go!
