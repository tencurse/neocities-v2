_Succession (2018)_, the TV series, reached its conclusion last Sunday, May 28th, 2023. As part of my _totally normal_ grieving process, I present to you a bingo card I made before Season 4 aired and what it looks like after.

I got into _Succession_ last year 2022, after seeing it so much on my Twitter feed. Who the hell is this Kendall guy and why are they calling this 40‚Äìyear‚Äìold grown‚Äìass man a babygirl? And like Eve taking a bite of the forbidden fruit, I bit into it. I just _had_ to know.

At the time, Season 3 had just ended, so I had lots of time catching up for when the next season comes.

And oh my god. I loved it. The first few episodes of Season 1 was a rough watch for me. I had to get used to these characters and their complete lack of a moral compass, but as the episodes flew by, I was already invested. I was gunning for Shiv Roy, because _of course_ I would latch on to the first female character I see.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Sarah Snook is gorgeous. Can you blame me for stanning her character?" %}

By Season 3, I was rooting for all of them to win and to be ruined at the same time. It‚Äôs so much fun watching them in this Sisyphean cycle of winning and failing, and on and on it goes, especially with my number one boy Kendall Roy, the king of failures.

The next thing I know, Season 4 was around the corner, and I did what everyone else was doing: I made a [bingo card](https://bingobaker.com/play/641a71a03135bde2) of my predictions for the final season.

## My predictions

There‚Äôs so much to unpack here. Most of these are explanatory, so I‚Äôll only go in‚Äìdepth to the ones I want to elaborate on.

The biggest thing I had on my predictions was: `logan dies`. I had no solid proof that he was going to die, it was just vibes. His character needed to die, imo, or else it would be the same old season for the Roys and it was getting a bit old at that point.

Related to that, I had `finale title: If He Had A Hundred Years`. If you didn‚Äôt know, the title of each season finale episode is from a poem titled [Dream Song 29](https://poets.org/poem/dream-song-29). It follows that for Season 4, the finale title would come from that, too. Now, my prediction was that Logan would die in the series finale, hence my choice of finale title: _If He Had A Hundred Years_.

Some of the boxes are just \[Character A\] fucking over \[Character B\], which is par for the course in the show full of backstabbing and betrayals.

`connor willa happy ending` is there because they‚Äôre honestly the closest thing the Roys have to a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù relationship, if you can even call it that. So, if anything, they‚Äôll have a happy ending, despite all odds. (The odds being that it is a transactional relationship built from money and this is something none of the Roys can escape from.)

Connor‚Äôs presidential campaign is honestly a wildcard to me. It seemed like a long shot, but honestly, wilder things have happened in the show. I didn‚Äôt put in that he would become POTUS, because that is definitely not happening, so instead, I put in `connor's campaign is thriving`. What does ‚Äòthriving‚Äô mean in this context, you say? I don‚Äôt fucking know.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "American election procedures are still so confusing to me, honestly." %}

`shiv miscarriage` ‚Äì oh, this one. A lot of the bingo cards had a Shiv pregnancy in there, and I honestly did not like that. The idea of the solitary main female character ending up pregnant? Oh, it‚Äôs such a tired and boring storyline. Upon rewatch of the Season 3 finale, I did feel that it‚Äôs a very possible thing that could happen, but I still did not want it. And so, out of spite, I predicted a pregnancy with a chance of miscarriage{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "When I made the bingo card, I had no idea Sarah Snook was pregnant during filming. (Though, of course, the character and the actress are two different people.)"%}, either induced or accidental. The bingo card also references (**spoiler** and also **sensitive** warning) [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deXQ9PMJgn0) from _Fleabag_{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Another show I love and treasure. Please please watch _Fleabag_ if you haven‚Äôt already. And if you have, it‚Äôs never a bad idea to watch it again!"%}.

`tom and shiv pretend everything is ok` ‚Äì theirs is a codependent and toxic relationship, and even though the idea of divorce might float around (and they would be right to do so), I felt that in the end, they still would stay together.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "It‚Äôs wishful thinking that they‚Äôd be happy together after all that happened between them and that makes me sad." %} Perhaps, they pretend everything is OK, ignoring the fact that they‚Äôre standing in a steaming pile of shit they call a marriage, in favour of the company or their unborn child.

## What actually happened

Not everything went as I predicted, but hey, I got two bingos!

First of all, Logan died in the third episode. Holy fucking shit. That episode was incredible, and also the sheer balls to kill off Logan Roy in the _third_ episode of the final season.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Hot take: it should have been done way earlier. Like season 1. And I‚Äôm only half‚Äìjoking. "%}

- `greg fucks over tom`: In the finale, when Greg rats out to Kendall that Matsson is looking into other US CEOs (Tom). In the end though, it still worked out for Tom.
- `connor willa happy ending`: They won.
- `tomgreg team up`: _‚ô™ The Disgusting Brothers ‚ô™_
- `no one goes to jail`: Are we really surprised?
- `tomgreg homoerotic sexual tension`: What if I held your hand and snorted coke on it and we were both guys? üò≥
- `marcia returns`: Good for her.
- `kendall goes manic`: Imagine finding out your father named you as the CEO after he died. Imagine finding out all this time, it really _was_ you. Number one boy.
- `kendall roman shiv alliance doesn't last`: Top 10 Anime Betrayals of all time and 8 of them are from Season 4{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "The biggest betrayal coming after the ‚ÄòMeal fit for a King‚Äô scene. Oh, I‚Äôm so sick."%}
- `shiv miscarriage`: I feel sorry for their kid üò≠
- `tom and shiv pretend everything is ok`: In a complicated relationship with power and control.
- `logan dies`: Yep.
- `physical assault moment`: It was _so_ painful to watch Kendall assaulting Roman in the finale, considering in the past Kendall was always the first to defend his siblings and his kids from Logan‚Äôs abuse. And now, he was so desperate to become his father that he resorts to physically hurting them.
  - Also Tom and Greg slapping each other in the finale, lol.
- `bachelor party goes wrong`: Logan crashes Connor‚Äôs (sad) karaoke party and doesn‚Äôt even sing!
- `roman homoerotic sexual tension`: What if you were a fascist and I have daddy issues and we were both guys? üò≥
- `roman mental breakdown`: Roman‚Äôs eulogy broke me just as it broke him.
- `kenstewy moment`: Stewy Hosseini said it best: ‚ÄúTeam Ken, baby!‚Äù
- `kendall manslaughter resurfaces`: Insane how Shiv brought it up as an excuse to change her mind{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Because let‚Äôs be real, she doesn‚Äôt really care that he‚Äôs a killer. Or that she did it to ‚Äòsave‚Äô him from being CEO. It was entirely a selfish move on her part." %} and equally insane how Kendall denied it and said he made it up just to secure his position as CEO. Like, that manslaughter has traumatized him since Season fucking 1 and utterly changed the trajectory of his life and his relationship with his father, and in the end, he just denies it ever happened. I feel so sick right now!

I‚Äôm still processing the last season, as you can evidently see. CEO Tom. Tom ‚Äòwinning‚Äô but it‚Äôs not really winning because he‚Äôs effectively a puppet, and was chosen specifically because he is‚Äîin Shiv‚Äôs words‚Äîservile. Kendall losing not only the position but his entire purpose in life. Roman finally able to get out of the succession game because he never really wanted it but couldn‚Äôt say it out loud. Shiv doing what Shiv needs: whatever gets her closer to power, or whatever gets her siblings out of it.

I wanted Kendall to ‚Äòwin‚Äô{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Win is in quotation marks because no one really wins in this show. They lose simply by virtue of playing the game."%}. At the end of the day, this show is all about _him_, it revolves around his story, and as someone rooting for him, I wanted him to get what he always wanted. The only thing he wanted, and what was promised to him ever since he was a kid, his only purpose in life. But really, at the end of the day, what he wanted was not the position of CEO. It was just a proxy to the real thing: his father‚Äôs love and approval. And once Logan died, that piece of paper declaring him CEO was the only thing holding his worth together. It confirmed what he wanted, that he was the chosen one, the number one boy. And he held onto it for his dear life.

Now, I don‚Äôt know if I wanted him to ‚Äòwin‚Äô or to ‚Äòlose‚Äô. The obviously healthiest thing for him is to get out of the game, but what happens if playing that game is the only thing you know? It was genuinely heartbreaking to see Kendall fumble desperately to win, to do and say whatever he needed, even if it meant destroying his relationships with his siblings and wife and kids and everyone else close to him.

Sigh. I really enjoyed this show and this last season especially. I could write a whole other blog post about _Succession_ and its stories of intergenerational trauma and abuse cycles, and inevitably becoming your father/mother{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "The last few episodes genuinely gave me an existential crisis about this."%}, and the whole Sisyphean bullshit of it all.

But this blog post is really about _Succession_ bingo, and I fucking won.
