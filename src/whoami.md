Howdy! I'm Kirsten (she/her) and I am both a woman of STEM and a woman of the arts. Software developer by day, fiction writer by (mid)night. I play the bass guitar as a hobby, largely inspired by Mitski and Arctic Monkeys. I love UNIX systems and how endlessly customizable they are. I enjoy playing video games and watching people play video games.

I'm a proponent of open source software and the ad-free web. Use Mozilla Firefox, install adblock of your choice, install SponsorBlock for YouTube. Support open source software and independent creators whenever you can. Dual-boot Linux, or throw away Windows altogether.[^1]

## About the site

This mobile-friendly site is handcrafted using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/), which is a static site generator. The aesthetic is inspired by UNIX systems and the terminal.

I will post the source code on my GitHub soon, but for now, feel free to right-click, Inspect Element or View Page Source. Everyone copy-pastes code, I assure you, but if you do, please take the time to learn what you are copy-pasting. Arm yourself with knowledge. With that said, I'll also add a page for resources on the tools I use for web development. Soon(tm)

For now, here are some basic details:

I built the site using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The HTML, CSS and JS are coded by hand, in combination with 11ty to make templating easier.

Terminal-style sidebar is inspired by [agnoster ohmyzsh theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster), and the 'fetch' command comes from [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), commonly found on UNIX systems.

Colour scheme is based on [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), though the light theme is tweaked a little bit for a smoother transition. I plan on adding more colour schemes, and if you want to see more, [check this out](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/)!

Here's a [tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web) on how I built the colour scheme button. I tweaked the JavaScript code a lot, and I'm sure I'll be changing it again in the future when I make it a toggle or a drop-down.

If you're interested in learning web development basics (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, etc), I encourage you to check out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It's a great course on web dev that teaches you the basics of the basics, encourages you to explore things for yourself, make your own mini-projects using what you learned, and see what others have created. It even teaches how to approach debugging, which is an _essential_ skill when learning to code.[^2]

[^1]: Itâ€™s not always the easiest (or even practical) in a capitalist world like this one. But we do our best.
[^2]: I found other free web dev courses are mostly built on memorization without _really_ diving deep into the fundamentals of _why_ and _how_, which leads to a lot of people not really understanding what they learned and feeling lost when there's no one to guide them.
