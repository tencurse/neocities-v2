Howdy! I'm **Kirsten (she/her)** and I am both a woman in STEM and the arts. Software developer by day, fiction writer by (mid)night. I play the bass guitar as a hobby, largely inspired by Mitski and Arctic Monkeys. I love Linux systems and how endlessly customizable they are. I enjoy playing video games and watching people play video games.

**I'm a proponent of open source software and the ad–free web.** Use Mozilla Firefox, install adblock of your choice, install SponsorBlock for YouTube. Support open source software and independent creators whenever you can. Dual–boot Linux, or throw away Windows altogether.[^1]

## About the site

This mobile–friendly site is handcrafted using 11ty on Firefox. The aesthetic is inspired by Linux systems and the terminal.

I will post the source code on my GitHub soon, but for now, feel free to right–click, Inspect Element or View Page Source. Everyone copy–pastes code, I assure you, but if you do, please take the time to learn what you are copy–pasting. Arm yourself with knowledge.

### Site credits

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – My trusty code editor. Free, customizable, open source. <3[^2]
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) – Simple, lightweight static site generator. Supports a bunch of templating languages. [Here’s a blog post on my journey building this site with 11ty.](</blog/2023-05-12 - Adventures with static site generators>)
- [agnoster ohmyzsh theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster) – Aesthetic inspiration for the sidebar. I also use this theme for my personal Linux terminal.
- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) – This is what the user info sidebar in the home page references. This command has a lot of other derivatives, and [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch) is my personal favourite.
- [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) – One of the biggest things that got me to dual–boot Linux. So much pretty customization while still retaining usability (…in some cases).
- [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) – Colour scheme used for the website and syntax highlighting. Light theme is tweaked a little for better contrast.
- [CSS Tricks, my beloved](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web) – Tutorial for implementing dark mode and light mode in your website. I tweaked the JavaScript code a lot to suit my needs.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) – Free online course on web development. It teaches the basics of the basics, encourages you to explore and fiddle with code, make your own mini–projects and see what others have created. It also teaches how to approach debugging, which is an _essential_ skill when learning to code.[^3]

[^1]: It’s not always the easiest (or even practical) in a capitalist world like this one. But we do our best.
[^2]: Still hate Microsoft, though.
[^3]: I found other free web dev courses are mostly built on memorization without _really_ diving deep into the fundamentals of _why_ and _how_, which leads to a lot of people not really understanding what they learned and feeling lost when there's no one to guide them.
