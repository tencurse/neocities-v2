> Just wanted to get the gang together early in my tenure to say... Yo.

Howdy! I’m **Kirsten (she/her)**. Software developer by day, fiction writer by (mid)night. I play the bass guitar as a hobby, largely inspired by Mitski and Arctic Monkeys. I love Linux systems and how endlessly customizable they are. I enjoy playing video games and watching people play video games.

**I’m a proponent of open source software and the ad–free web.** Use Mozilla Firefox, install adblock of your choice, install SponsorBlock for YouTube. Support open source software and independent creators whenever you can. Dual–boot Linux, or throw away Windows altogether.{% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "It’s not always the easiest (or even practical) in a capitalist world like this one. But we do our best." %}

## About the site

> Are you telling me a queer coded this?

This mobile–friendly site is handcrafted using 11ty for Firefox browsers. The aesthetic is inspired by Linux systems and the terminal.

See the source code on [Github](https://github.com/tencurse/neocities){% footnoteNum %}{% footnote "Feel free to contribute or leave feedback!" %}. Everyone copy–pastes code, I assure you, but if you do, please take the time to learn what you are copy–pasting. Arm yourself with knowledge.
